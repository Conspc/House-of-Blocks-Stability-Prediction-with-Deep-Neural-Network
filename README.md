# House-of-Blocks-Stability-Prediction-with-Deep-Neural-Network
In this project, I attemptted to predict the structural stability of block buildings that were render with Blender. determine the stability by leveraging the power of transfer learning (MobileNet).

The following is a sample of stable block buildings

A sample of Unstable block buildings
